    "\n",
    "## 1. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso)\n",
    "\n",
    "In <span style=\"color: red; \">Lasso regression</span>, loss function is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\rm Loss}({\\bm w}) = \\frac{1}{2} {||{\\bf y} - {\\bm X}^{T}{\\bm w}||}_{2}^{2} + \\lambda {||{\\bm w}||}_{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    ", where ${||{\\bm w}||}_{1}$ is L**1**-reguralization term, not L2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression adopts L1-regularization term to make as many elements of ${\\bf w}$ as possible equal to zero, while Ridge regression uses L2 to reduce the norm of ${\\bf w}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression has no analytical solution, since it has both a diffetentiable term ${||{\\bf y} - {\\bm X}^{T}{\\bm w}||}_{2}^{2}$ and a non-differentiable term $||{\\bm w}||_{1}$ using the same parameter ${\\bm w}$. Thus, we need to minimize the loss iteratively. One of the solution methods is <span style=\"color: red; \">ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers)</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Intorodusing ADMM\n",
    "\n",
    "In ADMM, we redefine the loss function as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "{\\rm Loss}({\\bm w}, {\\bm z}) = \\frac{1}{2} {||{\\bf y} - {\\bm X}^{T}{\\bm w}||}_{2}^{2} + \\lambda {||{\\bm z}||}_{1} \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is to the main objective ${||{\\bf y} - {\\bm X}^{T}{\\bm w}||}_{2}^{2}$ and the regularization term $\\lambda {||{\\bm z}||}_{1}$. Since these terms do not share the parameter ${\\bf w}$ anymore, they can be evaluated by considering separate cases based on absolute values. However, if the constraint is satisfied strictly, the function is equivalent to the original one. Therefore, we need to impose it loosely.\n",

    "- Penalty Method\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3-1. Lagrange Multiplier Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The well-known method for maximizing or minimizing the certain function under the constraint. We define the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "{\\mathcal L}({\\bm x}, {\\bm z}, {\\bm {\\gamma}}) &= {\\rm Loss}({\\bm w}, {\\bm z}) + {\\bm {\\gamma}}^{T}({\\bm w} - {\\bm z}) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    " &= \\frac{1}{2} {||{\\bm y} - {\\bm X}^{T}{\\bm w}||}_{2}^{2} + \\lambda {||{\\bm z}||}_{1} + {\\bm {\\gamma}}^{T}({\\bm w} - {\\bm z}) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ${\\gamma}^{T} \\in {\\mathbb R}^{d}$ is the Lagrange multipliers. Taking partial derivatives with respect to ${\\bm x}, {\\bm z}$ and ${\\gamma}$ and setting them to zero, we can find the extremum of the function. This is what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is very straightforward, and the time to obtain a solution is short.ã€€However, the constraint is satisfied strictly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3-2. Penalty Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method regards the constraint as the penalty, so to reduce the penalty helps to minimizing the loss function, but it is necessary to make it zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\rho > 0$ is a tuning parameter. The bigger $\\rho$ makes the constraint stricter. In this method, we increase $\\rho$ from a small value incrementally and perform optimization at each step. We can handle the impact of reguralization, but this costs much time.\n",
